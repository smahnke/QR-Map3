<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction.</h3>

<p>In The New Normal, Michael Warner (1999) discusses the zoning laws of New York that pushed out the queer public sphere in favor of market capital space. As Warner suggests, te erasure of queer spaces and places is symptom of societal regulation of sex through the delineation of the public/private (p. 161). Time Square, for instance, has demonstrated a cleansing of the commercial space, resulting in the removal of queer clubs, porn shops, adult stores, etc. Though Warner explores the various spaces of New York that have been affected, it is symptomatic of a nation-wide push to prioritize market capital over the creation of a democratic public sphere.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b8d44646f35233b913cde8af2b6d6b5f8ab17fe/c=0-20-1650-1261&r=x513&c=680x510/local/-/media/2015/09/01/MIGroup/Lansing/635766998825407050-East-Michigan-Avenue1.jpg">Photo from Lansing State Journal <a href="http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/picture-gallery/life/2015/09/03/from-the-archives-sin-strip-and-east-michigan-avenue/71507496/">Archives.</a></p>
<p>Lansing, Michigan has a history of public sex culture but has similarly faced challenges that limit the presence of adult establishments. A quick dig into Lansing State Journal's archive reveals Michigan Avenue as a once-hailed "Sin Strip" filled with adult theatres, LGBTQ bars, and adult shops lining the 500 block where Cooley Stadium now sits. It is a history few residents know because many public LGBTQ establishments have lived short lives, often struggling in the face of economic, commercial, and homophobic pressures.</p>
<p>What results from these spatial dispersals and erasures are commercialized representations of space that displace the LGBTQ community from the public to the private sphere. With global, governmental, and technological pressures cramping down on what's left of our democratic public, in general, the LGBTQ community is faced with an additional societal regulation of moving their sexual lives out of the open and into private domesticated spaces.</p>
<p>The aim of this Lansing mappig project is not just to provide an exploration of the forms and nature of the queer public sphere, but to provide a spatial means of envisioning their displacement from past and present locales. It also, alternatively, serves as a means of uncovering and reqriting Lansing's queer spaces onto the map; what was once invisible can then have a visible presence to establish what Warner asserts has been lacking in the queer movement: a visible LGBTQ lineage for the next generation gays. Finally, the map can have the additional didactic purpose of highlighting causal pressures for the removal of queer spaces which can inform thought on urban governance and the growing fallacy of democratic publics.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Production of Queer Space</h3>

<p>I draw from John Grube's (1997) definition of a 'democratic' public sphere as one wherein identities are visible, and particularly for public sexual culture, evidence of sexual nature is obvious. Explicit presence of the LGBTQ community in urban spaces is a strategic 'place-making' move, allowing sexual minorities to engage in networking, participate in activities, assert a respected existence, and dialogue and take part in the greater community.</p>
<p>The above Lansing sites contain a few underground spots, such as Stober's and Olsen's, but the majority of the establishments exerted a physically identifiable space in the city. The lesbian Club 505 could be considered a partial exception given the deliberately hidden nature of the building as described by professor <a href="http://lansingcitypulse.com/article-13652-hidden-then-and-now.html">Retzcloff</a>. The production of these queer spaces in Lansing seemed to be the result of at least three major factors: (1) the recognition of a gay space through gay ownership, such as the community's familiarity with Victor Cohenand bar-owner Tom Donnell through name and sometimes their iconic bar decor (Paradise/Excel, Spiral, Chrome Cat, and Trammps); (2) the trending movement of LGBTQ crowds, whether they were moving on from a competiting or recently closed gay establishment or turned away from a private establishment (Stober's, Chrome Cat, Spiral, JB's, and Esquire); and (3) non-LGBTQ affiliated owners welcoming the gay crowd for more profit possibilities (Covello's, and Stober's).</p>
        
<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges to Democratic Gay Space</h3>

<p>A measurement of inclusive municipal laws, policies, and services of LGBTQ people in Lansing received a 65/100 score on the <a href= "http://www.hrc.org/mei"> Municipal Equality Index 2016</a>, demonstrating that though the city is strong in non-discrimination laws, the city's commitment to including the LGBTQ community is still a work in progress. The departures of many of Lansing's adult sites seem to echo a more generally positive attitude toward the LGBTQ groups in recent years; crime and harassment that pushed gays out of establishments were mostly documente. Many of the more recent establishments departed due to financial and economic factors stemming rom (1) low attendance, exacerbated by newer competing LGBTQ bars; (2) business taxes; and (3) being bought out and/or pushed out for more mainstream commercial and residential businesses.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest removal of adult spaces in Lansing was the gradual removal of 'Sin Strip,' the 500 block of businesses bought by the city to create Cooley Law School Stadium. Then Lansing mayor David Hollister referred to the new development as replacing the <a href="http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2015/04/09/lugnuts-stadium-remain-key-downtown-lansings-rise/25523857/">sin strip filled with eyesores</a>. Since, the stadium has been surrounded by residential developments that have cropped up in the downtown area of straight-laced American bars, pubs, and nightlife.</p>
